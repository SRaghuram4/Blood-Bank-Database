# Blood-Bank-Database

```
This is an academic project where we had created a relational database using MySQL. 
The database is all about the bloodbanks situated in a city. 
It contains basic normalized entities which are associated with each other using identifying and 
non identifying relationships. 
Rest of the information about codes and ER Diagram are given in the pdf file above.
